fact = "The platypus's bill is not hard like a duck's, but soft and made of soft skin. It uses the snout to dig at the bottom of streams and it's electroreceptors detect the electric currents generated by its prey moving. The platypuses at the San Diego Safari Park are the only ones in the US. You can watch a livestream of their habitat here: https://sdzsafaripark.org/cams/platypus-cam"

fact = "American badgers are members of the weasel family and are considered indicators of *habitat connectivity* for conserved uplands in San Diego. If a badger can successfully find food and mates, this may indicate that other small wildlife that uses the same habitats will also succeed. The US Geological Survey has found 50 badger locations in San Diego and [is asking the public for help reporting sightings](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/werc/science/american-badgers-san-diego-county)."

animal = "Desert Cottontail"
image = "https://inaturalist-open-data.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/168161731/large.jpg"
fact = "The desert cottontail gets most of its water from the plants it eats or from dew, so it rarely needs to drink. For this reason, they change their diet each season to find vegetation with the most moisture content and nutritional value. Many rabbits and hares eat their feces in order to maximize nutritional value. Their ears make up 14% of their body size and help with thermoregulation, similarly to elephants."

animal = "Mountain lion"
image = "https://inaturalist-open-data.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/9834553/large.jpg"
fact = "Between 1906 and 1963, California instituted a statewide bounty on Mountain Lions that results in 12,000 of them being killed. Unlike gray wolves and grizzly bears, mountain lions persisted. They have been legally protected since 1972, helping the population slowly rise. Still, due to a number of threats, they are being considered for extra protection under the California Endangered Species Act. Two of the populations under consideration (in the Santa Ana Mountains and the Eastern Peninsular Range) are close to San Diego. They are seen occasionally in the northeastern portions of the county, including visiting California State University San Marcos, where they are the mascot."

animal = "Mexican fiddler crab"
image = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/08/Uca_perplexa_male_waving.gif"
fact = "The Mexican fiddler crab can be found in marshes and along beaches from the south of Mexico to Los Angeles. They wave their large claw in a courtship display to attract a made. The size of the crab's large claw determines the size of its burrow, which determines incubation temperature, so the female will pick a mate whose claw size indicates the best burrow environment for her eggs. She will carry her eggs under her body for two weeks, then leaves the burrow to release larvae which will develop for two more weeks. The crabs will live about two years."

animal = "California brown pelican"
image = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/Pelican_4995.jpg/495px-Pelican_4995.jpg"
fact = "With breeding grounds along the coasts of California and Baja, the California brown pelican's non-breeding range extends from British Columbia to Guatemala. It primarily stays within 20 miles of the coast, preferring shallow waters, and doesn't migrate. They are very social and live in flocks yearround. Brown and Peruvian pelicans are the only species of pelican that dive for prey like a kingfisher, with the brown pelican performing the highest dives. Their main prey, the pacific sardine, is a victim of overfishing, narrowing the pelican's available food supply."

fact = "The oldest fossil found related to the osprey, also known as the sea hawk, was found in southern California and dates back 13 to 16 million years. They have been featured in historical literature and folklore since Pliny the Elder (23-24 AD). In 2017, there was controversy in the Oergon state legislature over whether the osprey or the western meadowlark should be the state bird. In the end, the meadowlark became the state songbird, and the osprey the state raptor."

fact = "Peacocks first grow their signature tail plumage around three years of age, molting them at the end of each mating season and regrowing them longer and fuller before the beginning of the next. Their colors are most vibrant around age six. Some peahens may grow peacock feathers in old age adnd even make peacock calls. These attributes are repressed by hormones, which decrease with age. A group of peafowl are called an 'ostentation' or a 'muster.' "

fact = "Native American along the Pacific Coast commonly ate California mussels before European contact. Archeological evidence indicates they were likely harvested for close to 12,000 years. The concept of keystone species -- a species that has a disproportionately large effect on its natural environment relative to its abundance -- was coined to explain the relationship between California mussels and a species of starfish."

fact = "The yellow-faced bumble Bee is the most abundant bee in the range from Baja California to British Columbia. This bee builds it's colony underground and queens will incubate their own broods as well as those of other queens of the same species. Towards the end of the season, the queen will contribute to food foraging as the number of drones declines. This way, it contributes to the well-being of the next generation of bees."

fact = "According to Greek mythology, the Hippocampus is a creature with the head and limbs of a horse and the lower body of a fish. Thanks to its distinctive horse-like head and long body, the scientific Genus for seahorse, Hippocampus, makes perfect sense. The elegant Hippocampus is famous for leading Poseidon’s chariot and Long-snout Seahorses are just as elegant, even if smaller in size. The similarities between the two are strong, however Hippocampi lack the prehensile tails that Longsnout Seahorses use to hold onto aquatic plants or other things they can anchor to in their environment. The Long Snout Seahorse can be seen at Birch Aquarium."

fact = "Royal Terns nest in dense colonies. They tolerate others of their species except during the height of courtship, when males are prone to squabbling with each other. Royal Terns are very sensitive to disturbance at nesting colonies and may abandon them if people, dogs, or predators approach too closely. As human populations grow and gather on beaches in increasing numbers, colony disturbance can become a serious problem."

animal = "Aphid"
image = "https://inaturalist-open-data.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/13046947/medium.jpg"
fact = "Aphids feed by piercing the phloem tissue of the host plant and sucking up the sap. Unfortunately, sap is mostly sugar, so an aphid must consume a lot of sap to meet its nutritional requirement for protein. Much of what the aphid consumes goes to waste. The excess sugar is eliminated in the form of a sugary droplet called honeydew. Some ant species will herd aphids and harvest them for the honeydew. Most aphids have a pair of tubular structures on their hind ends, which entomologists describe as looking like tiny tailpipes and seem to serve a defensive purpose. When threatened, an aphid releases a waxy fluid from the cornicles, which gums up the mouth of the predator in pursuit and is thought to trap parasitoids before they can infect the aphid."

Northern chuckwallas generally live 10 years or more, given suitable conditions, limited predation, and adequate food availability. The average lifespan in the wild is estimated to be about 15 years. The oldest known chuckwalla in the wild was 30 years old, while the oldest in captivity lived to 65 years old."

fact = "The tripartite sweat bee is common in the western United States, especially, the southwestern coast. It builds nests in burrows under the soil consisting of four to 200 bees. Unlike most bees, some tripartite workers are capable of mating and reproducing. Only females have stingers, but they are non-aggressive, stinging only for defense. Sweat bees are attracted to human perspiration, likely for the salts and proteins."
